# elm-testground

As the name suggests, this repo is a collection of different ideas, concepts or techniques i want to try and explore in Elm. Also as it hopefully grows over time, it should serve me as a collection of references and examples.

I decided to make it public, basically becaus why not? A big reason why I love Elm is the community. By sharing this repo I hope I can make my very first small contribution back. Maybe as an inspiration of what topics one could dive into. Mayb somthing completely else. 

## Structure

I'm trying to make each project as small and focused as possible, so each lives in its own sub-folder. 

## Projects to come:

- Experimenting with [elm-ui](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/mdgriffith/elm-ui/latest/)
- Phantom Types
- [Working with Files](https://elm-lang.org/news/working-with-files)
- [elm-3d-scene](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/ianmackenzie/elm-3d-scene/latest/)
- Connect to IndexedDB
- Project setup with Parcel and TypeScript-Interop
- Elm Test
- SPA-Navigation
